<h2>About Me
</h2>

<p>My name is Danny Pickard and I have been running Minuteman Electric for almost 15 years in the greater Charlotte Area.  Previously I worked for the City of Detroit as a head electrician for over a decade.</p>
<p>I served two tours in the Navy and this instilled a great sense of community and pride in me that I apply to my everyday work.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Discuss the mission of the company</p>

<h2>About Page Responses</h2>
<p> A) The purpose of this website is to advertise the electricial services of Minuteman Electric.  They are able to perform any electricial needs including residential, industrial, and commericial work.  I made sure to talk a little bit about the services that can be provided with estimated prices, provided photos of some finished projects, shown some reviews, and included the contact information.
	</p>
	<p> B) My focus on this website was to make it easy to use for the user while providing sufficient information about the electrical company.  On every page I kept the header the same with the logo, phone number, and the pages list.  I also tried to keep a similar text format and coloring for all the pages.  I focused on using a light blue with red and included these colors as boxes around the text with a white background.  This helped the text stand out and made it easy to read.  On the home page, I thought it was important to put a face on the company so I used my "uncle's" picture at work.  I also wanted to include some quick information about the comapny, but I kept it short and tried spreading it out across the page to make it more appealing.  I also selected a finished project that I thought was visiually appealing to show off the work.  I lastly included a video that is a commerical of the company (actually a SNHU commericial).  The about us page talks a little bit about my uncle and his background.  I also included a place for the mission statement.  I thought it was important for the user to see who my uncle is along with his experience and the company's mission.  Since this is a veteran owned company, I wanted to include a picture of our US Navy.  My main focus on the services page was showing some of the common services with an estimated price.  I decided to put this in a table to keep it organized and easy to read.  The Finished projects page is focused on being visually appealing, so I did not include any information, just photos of the work itself.  On the reviews / testimonials page, I included a couple reviews from clients as well as added a form that can be completed by the user to leave a review.  Finally the contact us page is short and simple.  I wanted to provide the user with the contact information as well as the company hours.  I kept the text short to make the focus on the contact information.
	</p>
	<o> C) My uncle actually does own his own electrician business, so I could potentially update this site for him to use in the future if he wished.  I'm not sure that I would add any pages, but one thing that was bothering me was the fact that my footer was moving around the page a bit. I would like it to stay at the bottom, but wasn't able to figure out exactly how to do that.  A real company logo I believe would have helped it look more professional.  I would like to set up the form on the testimonial page to actually work and leave reviews that can be viewed on the page.  With some javascript, I believe that would be possible.  Overall, I like the site I have created, but it doesn't look professional enough for me.  I can't exactly pinpoint any one thing, but something about the overall site just isn't up to the standard I would like.  I'm hoping as I create more sites, that I am able to get closer to my goal.
